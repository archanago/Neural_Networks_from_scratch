# Visualization of global temperature trends from Global Temperature Anomaly dataset:
The Global Temperature Anomaly dataset consists of the global temperatures recorded from the year 1880 to 2016 in JSON format. 
Let's see how the data can be visualised for easier analysis of the data. 
For this, we're going to use Python 3 and work on a Jupyter notebook.
The dataset used in this experiment can be found
